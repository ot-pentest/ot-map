    <title>SSA-723487 V1.5 (Last Update: 2025-03-11): RADIUS Protocol Susceptible to Forgery Attacks (CVE-2024-3596) - Impact to SCALANCE, RUGGEDCOM and Related Products</title>
    <updated>2025-03-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-723487.html" rel="alternate"/>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;This advisory documents the impact of CVE-2024-3596 (also dubbed &#8220;Blastradius&#8221;), a vulnerability in the RADIUS protocol, to SCALANCE, RUGGEDCOM and related products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability could allow on-path attackers, located between a Network Access Server (the RADIUS client, e.g., SCALANCE or RUGGEDCOM devices) and a RADIUS server (e.g., SINEC INS), to forge Access-Request packets in a way that enables them to modify the corresponding server response packet at will, e.g., turning an &#8220;Access-Reject&#8221; message into an &#8220;Access-Accept&#8221;. This would cause the Network Access Server to grant the attackers access to the network with the attackers desired authorization (and without the need of knowing or guessing legitimate access credentials).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further details incl.&#160;external references can be found in the chapter &#8220;Additional Information&#8221;. Siemens has released new versions for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions, and to configure the updated systems as recommended in the chapter &#8220;Additional Information&#8221;. Siemens is preparing further fix versions and recommends specific countermeasures for products where fixes are not, or not yet available.

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;This advisory documents the impact of CVE-2024-3596 (also dubbed &#8220;Blastradius&#8221;), a vulnerability in the RADIUS protocol, to SCALANCE, RUGGEDCOM and related products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability could allow on-path attackers, located between a Network Access Server (the RADIUS client, e.g., SCALANCE or RUGGEDCOM devices) and a RADIUS server (e.g., SINEC INS), to forge Access-Request packets in a way that enables them to modify the corresponding server response packet at will, e.g., turning an &#8220;Access-Reject&#8221; message into an &#8220;Access-Accept&#8221;. This would cause the Network Access Server to grant the attackers access to the network with the attackers desired authorization (and without the need of knowing or guessing legitimate access credentials).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further details incl.&#160;external references can be found in the chapter &#8220;Additional Information&#8221;. Siemens has released new versions for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions, and to configure the updated systems as recommended in the chapter &#8220;Additional Information&#8221;. Siemens is preparing further fix versions and recommends specific countermeasures for products where fixes are not, or not yet available.

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;Affected models of the S7-1500 CPU product family do not contain an Immutable Root of Trust in Hardware. With this the integrity of the code executed on the device can not be validated during load-time. An attacker with physical access to the device could use this to replace the boot image of the device and execute arbitrary code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As exploiting this vulnerability requires physical tampering with the product, Siemens recommends to assess the risk of physical access to the device in the target deployment and to implement measures to make sure that only trusted personnel have access to the physical hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability is related to the hardware of the product. Siemens has released new hardware versions for several CPU types of the S7-1500 product family in which this vulnerability is fixed and is working on new hardware versions for remaining PLC types to address this vulnerability completely. See the chapter &#8220;Additional Information&#8221; below for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability could allow on-path attackers, located between a Network Access Server (the RADIUS client, e.g., SCALANCE or RUGGEDCOM devices) and a RADIUS server (e.g., SINEC INS), to forge Access-Request packets in a way that enables them to modify the corresponding server response packet at will, e.g., turning an &#8220;Access-Reject&#8221; message into an &#8220;Access-Accept&#8221;. This would cause the Network Access Server to grant the attackers access to the network with the attackers desired authorization (and without the need of knowing or guessing legitimate access credentials).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further details incl.&#160;external references can be found in the chapter &#8220;Additional Information&#8221;. Siemens has released new versions for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions, and to configure the updated systems as recommended in the chapter &#8220;Additional Information&#8221;.

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;LOGO! V8.3 BM (incl.&#160;SIPLUS variants) devices contain a vulnerability that could allow an electromagnetic fault injection. This could allow an attacker to dump and debug the firmware, including the manipulation of memory. Further actions could allow to inject public keys of custom created key pairs which are then signed by the LOGO! V8.3 Product CA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability is related to the specific hardware architecture of the LOGO! V8.3 BM. Siemens has released new hardware versions with the LOGO! V8.4 BM and the SIPLUS LOGO! V8.4 BM product families for several affected devices in which the vulnerability is fixed and the Product CA private key is rotated. Siemens is working on new hardware versions for the SIPLUS devices to address this issue further. See the chapter &#8220;Additional Information&#8221; below for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;Affected models of the S7-1500 CPU product family do not contain an Immutable Root of Trust in Hardware. With this the integrity of the code executed on the device can not be validated during load-time. An attacker with physical access to the device could use this to replace the boot image of the device and execute arbitrary code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As exploiting this vulnerability requires physical tampering with the product, Siemens recommends to assess the risk of physical access to the device in the target deployment and to implement measures to make sure that only trusted personnel have access to the physical hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability is related to the hardware of the product. Siemens has released new hardware versions for several CPU types of the S7-1500 product family in which this vulnerability is fixed and is working on new hardware versions for remaining PLC types to address this vulnerability completely. See the chapter &#8220;Additional Information&#8221; below for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;Affected models of the S7-1500 CPU product family do not contain an Immutable Root of Trust in Hardware. With this the integrity of the code executed on the device can not be validated during load-time. An attacker with physical access to the device could use this to replace the boot image of the device and execute arbitrary code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As exploiting this vulnerability requires physical tampering with the product, Siemens recommends to assess the risk of physical access to the device in the target deployment and to implement measures to make sure that only trusted personnel have access to the physical hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability is related to the hardware of the product. Siemens has released new hardware versions for several CPU types of the S7-1500 product family in which this vulnerability is fixed and is working on new hardware versions for remaining PLC types to address this vulnerability completely. See the chapter &#8220;Additional Information&#8221; below for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;Affected models of the S7-1500 CPU product family do not contain an Immutable Root of Trust in Hardware. With this the integrity of the code executed on the device can not be validated during load-time. An attacker with physical access to the device could use this to replace the boot image of the device and execute arbitrary code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As exploiting this vulnerability requires physical tampering with the product, Siemens recommends to assess the risk of physical access to the device in the target deployment and to implement measures to make sure that only trusted personnel have access to the physical hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability is related to the hardware of the product. Siemens has released new hardware versions for several CPU types of the S7-1500 product family in which this vulnerability is fixed and is working on new hardware versions for remaining PLC types to address this vulnerability completely. See the chapter &#8220;Additional Information&#8221; below for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SSA-568427 V1.0: Weak Key Protection Vulnerability in SIMATIC S7-1200 and S7-1500 CPU Families</title>
    <updated>2022-10-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-568427.pdf" rel="alternate"/>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;SIMATIC S7-1200, S7-1500 CPUs and related products protect the built-in global private key in a way that cannot be considered sufficient any longer. The key is used for the legacy protection of confidential configuration data and the legacy PG/PC and HMI communication.&lt;br /&gt;
This could allow attackers to discover the private key of a CPU product family by an offline attack against a single CPU of the family. Attackers could then use this knowledge to extract confidential configuration data from projects that are protected by that key or to perform attacks against legacy PG/PC and HMI communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siemens recommends to update both the affected products as well as the corresponding TIA Portal project to the latest versions. TIA Portal V17 and related CPU firmware versions introduced protection of confidential configuration data based on individual passwords per device and TLS-protected PG/PC and HMI communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional details can be found in the related Siemens security bulletin SSB-898115 (&lt;a href="https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssb-898115.html" class="uri"&gt;https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssb-898115.html&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;On 2021-12-09, a vulnerability in Apache Log4j (a logging tool used in many Java-based applications) was disclosed, that could allow remote unauthenticated attackers to execute code on vulnerable systems. The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2021-44228 and is also known as &#8220;Log4Shell&#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 2021-12-14 an additional denial of service vulnerability (CVE-2021-45046) was published rendering the initial mitigations and fix in version 2.15.0 as incomplete under certain non-default configurations. Log4j versions 2.16.0 and 2.12.2 are supposed to fix both vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 2021-12-17, CVE-2021-45046 was reclassified with an increased CVSS base score (from 3.7 to 9.0). The potential impact of CVE-2021-45046 now includes - besides denial of service - also information disclosure and local (and potential remote) code execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siemens is currently investigating to determine which products are affected and is continuously updating this advisory as more information becomes available. See section Additional Information for more details regarding the investigation status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: two additional vulnerabilities were published for Apache Log4j, the impact of which are documented in SSA-501673: &lt;a href="https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-501673.pdf" class="uri"&gt;https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-501673.pdf&lt;/a&gt; (CVE-2021-45105) and SSA-784507: &lt;a href="https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-784507.pdf" class="uri"&gt;https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-784507.pdf&lt;/a&gt; (CVE-2021-44832).&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;On 2021-12-09, a vulnerability in Apache Log4j (a logging tool used in many Java-based applications) was disclosed, that could allow remote unauthenticated attackers to execute code on vulnerable systems. The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2021-44228 and is also known as &#8220;Log4Shell&#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 2021-12-14 an additional denial of service vulnerability (CVE-2021-45046) was published rendering the initial mitigations and fix in version 2.15.0 as incomplete under certain non-default configurations. Log4j versions 2.16.0 and 2.12.2 are supposed to fix both vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 2021-12-17, CVE-2021-45046 was reclassified with an increased CVSS base score (from 3.7 to 9.0). The potential impact of CVE-2021-45046 now includes - besides denial of service - also information disclosure and local (and potential remote) code execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siemens is currently investigating to determine which products are affected and is continuously updating this advisory as more information becomes available. See section Additional Information for more details regarding the investigation status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: two additional vulnerabilities were published for Apache Log4j, the impact of which are documented in SSA-501673: &lt;a href="https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-501673.pdf" class="uri"&gt;https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-501673.pdf&lt;/a&gt; (CVE-2021-45105) and SSA-784507: &lt;a href="https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-784507.pdf" class="uri"&gt;https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-784507.pdf&lt;/a&gt; (CVE-2021-44832).&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;A Denial-of-Service vulnerability was found in SIMATIC PCS 7, SIMATIC WinCC and SIMATIC NET PC software when encrypted communication is enabled. The vulnerability could allow an attacker with network access to cause a Denial-of-Service condition under certain circumstances (versions prior to SIMATIC WinCC V7.3 or SIMATIC PCS 7 V8.1 are not affected as encrypted communication is not an option).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions. Siemens recommends specific countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: The vulnerability is part of a shared component, used by various Siemens products (SIMATIC Communication Services - SCS). The installation of a fix version of any product also removes the vulnerability for other products on the same system, even if those products were not updated.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;On 2021-12-09, a vulnerability in Apache Log4j (a logging tool used in many Java-based applications) was disclosed, that could allow remote unauthenticated attackers to execute code on vulnerable systems. The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2021-44228 and is also known as &#8220;Log4Shell&#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 2021-12-14 an additional denial of service vulnerability (CVE-2021-45046) was published rendering the initial mitigations and fix in version 2.15.0 as incomplete under certain non-default configurations. Log4j versions 2.16.0 and 2.12.2 are supposed to fix both vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 2021-12-17, CVE-2021-45046 was reclassified with an increased CVSS base score (from 3.7 to 9.0). The potential impact of CVE-2021-45046 now includes - besides denial of service - also information disclosure and local (and potential remote) code execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siemens is currently investigating to determine which products are affected and is continuously updating this advisory as more information becomes available. See section Additional Information for more details regarding the investigation status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: two additional vulnerabilities were published for Apache Log4j, the impact of which are documented in SSA-501673: &lt;a href="https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-501673.pdf" class="uri"&gt;https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-501673.pdf&lt;/a&gt; (CVE-2021-45105) and SSA-784507: &lt;a href="https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-784507.pdf" class="uri"&gt;https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-784507.pdf&lt;/a&gt; (CVE-2021-44832).&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;On 2021-12-09, a vulnerability in Apache Log4j (a logging tool used in many Java-based applications) was disclosed, that could allow remote unauthenticated attackers to execute code on vulnerable systems. The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2021-44228 and is also known as &#8220;Log4Shell&#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 2021-12-14 an additional denial of service vulnerability (CVE-2021-45046) was published rendering the initial mitigations and fix in version 2.15.0 as incomplete under certain non-default configurations. Log4j versions 2.16.0 and 2.12.2 are supposed to fix both vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 2021-12-17, CVE-2021-45046 was reclassified with an increased CVSS base score (from 3.7 to 9.0). The potential impact of CVE-2021-45046 now includes - besides denial of service - also information disclosure and local (and potential remote) code execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siemens is currently investigating to determine which products are affected and is continuously updating this advisory as more information becomes available. See section Additional Information for more details regarding the investigation status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: two additional vulnerabilities were published for Apache Log4j, the impact of which are documented in SSA-501673: &lt;a href="https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-501673.pdf" class="uri"&gt;https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-501673.pdf&lt;/a&gt; (CVE-2021-45105) and SSA-784507: &lt;a href="https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-784507.pdf" class="uri"&gt;https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-784507.pdf&lt;/a&gt; (CVE-2021-44832).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 2021-12-14 an additional denial of service vulnerability (CVE-2021-45046) was published rendering the initial mitigations and fix in version 2.15.0 as incomplete under certain non-default configurations. Log4j versions 2.16.0 and 2.12.2 are supposed to fix both vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 2021-12-17, CVE-2021-45046 was reclassified with an increased CVSS base score (from 3.7 to 9.0). The potential impact of CVE-2021-45046 now includes - besides denial of service - also information disclosure and local (and potential remote) code execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siemens is currently investigating to determine which products are affected and is continuously updating this advisory as more information becomes available. See section Additional Information for more details regarding the investigation status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: an additional but unrelated vulnerability, CVE-2021-45105, was published for Apache Log4j, the impact of which is documented in SSA-501673: &lt;a href="https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-501673.pdf" class="uri"&gt;https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-501673.pdf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;Siemens has released version V13.1.0.1 for JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization to fix multiple vulnerabilities that could be triggered when the products read files in different file formats (BMP, TIFF, CGM, TGA, PCT, HPG, PLT, RAS, PAR, ASM, DXF, DWG). If a user is tricked to opening of a malicious file with the affected products, this could lead to application crash, or potentially arbitrary code execution or data extraction on the target host system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siemens recommends to update to the latest versions and to limit opening of untrusted files from unknown sources in the affected products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous versions of this advisory incorrectly listed the following vulnerabilities as being fixed in V13.1.0.1: CVE-2020-26991, CVE-2020-26998, CVE-2020-26999, CVE-2020-27001 and CVE-2020-27002. Those were fixed in V13.1.0.2 and are therefore addressed in advisory SSA-695540 [0]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability CVE-2020-28383 was incorrectly listed in SSA-622830 [1] as being fixed in V13.1.0.0. This was fixed in V13.1.0.1 and therefore added here&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Open Design Alliance [2] recently disclosed an additional vulnerability (CVE-2021-31784) which is also covered in this advisory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;Siemens SCALANCE W1750D is a brandlabled device. Aruba has released a related security advisory (ARUBA-PSA-2016-004) [0] disclosing vulnerabilities in its Aruba Instant product line. The advisory contains multiple related vulnerabilities that are summarized in CVE-2016-2031.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This advisory is a reminder to customers that the PAPI protocol is not a secure protocol and that some device configurations must be taken to mitigate risks. Although this information was previously disclosed, an impending public disclosure by the Google Security Team (focused on Aruba Instant) will call out the vulnerable details of this protocol and bring it to the attention of the attacker community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siemens recommends specific countermeasures until fixes are available.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;SPPA-T3000 Application Server and MS3000 Migration Server are affected by multiple vulnerabilities. Some of the vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. Exploitation of the vulnerabilities described in this advisory requires access to either Application- or Automation Highway. Both highways should not be exposed if the environment has been set up according to the recommended system configuration in the Siemens SPPA-T3000 security manual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case Siemens considers the environmental score as CR:L/IR:L/AR:H/MAV:A for vulnerabilities related to the Application Server and CR:L/IR:L/AR:M/MAV:A for vulnerabilities related to the Migration Server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siemens provides a service pack to fix vulnerabilities on the Application Server and recommends configurations to mitigate the vulnerabilities in the Migration Server. Detailed information will be available for SPPA-T3000 customers in the Siemens Energy Customer Portal.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;Security experts have examined the SIMATIC S7-1200 Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). This research has revealed some weaknesses in the SIMATIC S71200 CPU communication and authentication functions. Once the automation network is compromised it is possible to demonstrate the following weaknesses using a remote exploit: - Trigger CPU functions by record and playback of legitimate network communication - Place CPU in stop/defect state by causing a communications error A remote exploit is a type of attack that can be launched from one computer against another computer across a network. For example, a PC with access to the automation network could be used to launch a remote exploit against a PLC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weaknesses are closed with a firmware update V 2.0.3. For the second weakness (communications error), a temporary work-around is also available: if the Web server on the S7-1200 is disabled, the weakness cannot be exploited.&lt;/p&gt;
